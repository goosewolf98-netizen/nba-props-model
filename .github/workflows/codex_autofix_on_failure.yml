            The workflow "player-query-bundle" failed. Fix it with the smallest patch.
            Use repo logs/artifacts (artifacts/feature_factory.log, train.log, predict.log) to find the exception.
            Common issues: game_date dtype mismatch, missing team_abbr/opp_abbr/min columns.
            Add schema normalizers so merges never crash.
            Do not change model logic unless necessary.
            Commit changes and open a PR titled "Codex: fix CI failure".
